# Changelog

All notable changes to ffix-roguelike are documented here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

Initial scaffold: a Better-T-Stack monorepo for a browser roguelite built on Final Fantasy IX's battle, gear and ability systems.

### Added
- Better-T-Stack monorepo (create-better-t-stack 3.36.3, matching ChannelGuide): TanStack Router web app, Hono-on-Bun server, tRPC, Prisma/Postgres, Better Auth, Turborepo, pnpm 10.34.7.
- `pnpm version:bump` (`scripts/bump-version.ts`) and the `/version-bump` skill — every `apps/*/package.json` bumps in lockstep.
